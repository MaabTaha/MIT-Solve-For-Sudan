# MIT-Solve-For-Sudan
## Overview
The education system in Sudan has faced significant challenges, particularly exacerbated by the outbreak of war in April 2023. This conflict not only disrupted daily life but also brought the education sector to a grinding halt at all levels. Schools and universities were forced to close their doors, leaving millions of students without access to education and putting their future prospects at risk.

In the aftermath of the war, millions of university students find themselves seeking opportunities to continue their education and pursue their degrees. However, amidst the chaos, there is a glaring absence of a dedicated platform to equip these students with essential information about available scholarships and universities. This lack of centralized information poses a significant barrier to students, especially those from marginalized communities, who may struggle to navigate the complex landscape of higher education without proper guidance.
